# GarbageCam
## A garbage camera for garbage people

Hello friends! As you've [no doubt](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJaQgX4hvQb/) been [able](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJdU0CkhMcj/) to [tell](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJdVIJdB3HK/), I've been making some weird looking images lately with my phone.

Since I'm a ~~currently-unemployed programmer with a github that hasn't been updated in 4 years~~ kind individual, I've decided to put the source for my little app online so y'all can make crazy looking images too. I've made the source a bit more modular so I can update it to make other weird-looking images; feel free to add your own features too and make PRs, that would be rad.

As you can tell, this is my first time writing swift. I am probably bad at it. I write it like I write java. If there're errors or stylistic tips, feel free to let me know. You don't even need to write a PR. Just email me and tell me my code sucks. This is not something you'll see on github often, but I want to learn, so make the best of it.
